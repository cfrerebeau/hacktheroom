Hello, I am the hacker anonymous. I have a message to the world. . .
Your kids spend too much time playing video game. 
This should stop. 
In exactly one hour, I will release a virus that will destroy all video games all over the world. 
Say goodbye to iPad, play station, Xbox and all other type of video games.
Kids will be free to enjoy playing with others. 
I left a way to stop the virus from spreading. In my childhood house, I left a set of enigma. 
If a group of 7 and 8 year old children can find the solution before one hour, it will stop the virus. 
Good luck
