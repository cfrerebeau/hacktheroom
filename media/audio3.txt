Do you prefer trains or maps? I actually loved both. My first passion was the London underground map. Find some maps in my suitcase. The first letter will open the suitcase if you start in Morningston Crescent, go to Euston, make a stop to buy a newspaper, then go back to the station and go straight home in Kentish Town.
