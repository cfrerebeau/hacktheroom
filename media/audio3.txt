Do you prefer trains or maps? I actually loved both. My first passion was the London underground map. First look for maps in my suitcase. Then try to open it. Find the passcode using the first letters. Start from Morningston Crescent, go to Euston, exit, then go back to the station and go straight home to Kentish Town, using the fastest route.
